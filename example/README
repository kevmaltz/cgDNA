Glucose oxidase (GOx, pdb:1GPE chain A) and Horseradish peroxidase (HRP, pdb:1ATJ chain A)
proteins structures are provided as examples. To convert these all-atom structures to 
one-bead-per-residue structures, use the following commands:

../cgProtein -p GOxa.pdb > GOx.rbbd
../cgProtein -p HRPa.pdb > HRP.rbbd

The new ".rbbd" files contain a coarse grained, rigid body description of each protein.
